<p>                Leland Olds was a public servant who served on the Federal Power Commission from 1939 to 1949. He was born in Rochester, New York. While he was studying mathematics at Amherst College, he worked summers at a school in industrial Holyoke, Massachusetts. There, he was to say, "I learned at first hand the impact of the industrialism of that period on the lives of the children of wage earners." After he graduated, he began a decades-long pursuit of the cause of mitigating poverty.
</p>
<p>                His search took him from place to place as he saw each of his efforts come up short. He found he couldn't do enough as a social worker, that the Church wouldn't involve itself in anti-poverty work as a minister. When hired as a statistician to study how wages should be set during World War I, he showed a knack for analyzing large amounts of data. That data convinced him that collective bargaining rights were the key to addressing the poverty of the working class. He worked as the head researcher for the American Federation of Labor, seeing up-close the brutality of the response to worker protests and the lengths corporations would go to to keep their employees disempowered.
</p>                <p>
<p>                    Olds gained recognition as a writer for the Federated Press, a wire service for union-related publications. Through the 1920s, he began to lose hope that the labor movement would succeed. All levels of government were hesitant to impose any regulations on big business and were hostile to labor rights. He began to narrow his focus to to fair pricing in the energy industry. Gov. Franklin Roosevelt consulted Olds on the regulation of power companies in New York and appointed him to the New York State Power Authority. Then, in 1939, Roosevelt appointed him to the Federal Power Commission, a New Deal agency which had been struggling.
</p>
<p>                    Leland Olds was uniquely qualified for the position. His broad knowledge of economics, interest in regulating power companies, and ability to analyze data gave him insight the other commissioners and staff had lacked. He pressured utilities to extend their networks into rural areas and to lower rates. He used the FPC's broad powers to regulate natural gas to bring prices down sharply. He banned deceptive account practices they had used to hide profits. While the gas companies continued to succeed, they were bitterly opposed to his efforts.
</p>
<p>                    His career was to end at the hands of Lyndon Johnson. Johnson was elected to the Senate in 1948 with the most expensive campaign in Texas history. The Texas oilmen who had provided the funds demanded Johnson return the favor by forcing Olds out of the FPC. When his renomination came up in 1949, olds was false branded as a Communist by Johnson and other conservatives on the committee. His renomination failed, and he struggled financially until President Truman created a position to provide him with a salary until 1953. Thereafter, he would never work in public service. He died in 1960 at the age of 69.
